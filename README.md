Implementations of quantum algorithms on IBM quantum computer
The project is meant to implement quantum algorithms on IBM quantum computer. Codes will be implement is quantum software kit : https://qiskit.org/
The project here will be 3-folds, \\
a). Implement the quantum and classical algorithms and compare their space and time complexity. 
b). Quantum simulations of molecular Hamiltonian using variational quantum eigensolver. More about it :  http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vqe.html, and paper : https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=QIM-2017-QF6A.2 
c). Integrate QISKIT with OpenFermion by Google for molecular simulations.  More about OpenFermion : https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion, and paper :https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07629
